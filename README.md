As a developer, I want Bragi to interact with me or my code via conversations on Issues and Pull Requests, so that all changes are well documented and I can learn from them.

As a developer, I want to be informed about branch protection rules, so that I can follow them, and so that Bragi will be able to help me to follow them by configuring Prow's branch protection plugin provided by Operate First.
